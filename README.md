# Tripartite-CRISPR-diversity
Code for surveying the intra-subtype and spacer acquisition diversity across CRISPR-Cas subtypes. This code was originally designed to be run as a single integrated workflow, however this approach was not implemented and most code was instead run seperately. As a result, some scripts contain functions and unused sections of code which were not utilised. These will be progressively deleted.

Note: Many of the scripts and code were originally run from a single fixed directory (/g/data/va71/crispr_pipeline_annotation) on a computing cluster. These have not yet been adapted for standalone use. As such running from each chapter specific folder may produce dependency and pathing errors. I will work to fix these issues progressively in a seperate branch.

The code utilised the following dependencies:
