# Tripartite-CRISPR-diversity
Code for surveying the intra-subtype and spacer acquisition diversity across CRISPR-Cas subtypes.
Note: Many of the scripts and code were originally run from a fixed directory (/g/data/va71/crispr_pipeline_annotation) on a computing cluster. These have not yet been adapted for standalone use.
